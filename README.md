# Bike Sharing Demand Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on understanding the factors that influence bike-sharing demand through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By examining user behavior, weather conditions, and time patterns, the analysis provides insights that can help optimize bike-sharing operations, forecast demand, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for bike-sharing data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations to identify demand patterns.
- Analysis of time trends, weather influence, and user behavior.
- Identification of peak usage times and factors affecting bike rentals.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualizations)
